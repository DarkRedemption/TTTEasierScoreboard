# TTTEasierScoreboard
TTTEasierScoreboard is an upcoming project meant to replace Rejax's TTTEasyScoreboard.

## Design Goals
* Create two columns: Rank and Title. Rank indicates a user's permissions. Title is for custom things.
* Allow users to change their Title from a premade list that the Admins have created.
* Allow specific users to change their Title and its color, such as if they donated to the server or are an admin.
* Allow users to change their Rank if there are equivalents. I.e. "Superadmin" may also be "Owner" or "Founder".
* Allow all of the above changes to be done in-game through a GUI.
* Create an API to allow outside addons to dynamically award Titles to players without having to do their own Database manipulation.
* Allow setting of titles through command-line input in addition to the GUI.
* Allow setting of username color if permissions are granted to that user to do so.
* Set permanent permissions, such as for Admins to change other people's permissions on the fly, in a config file.
